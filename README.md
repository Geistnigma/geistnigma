## 👋 Hello there!

I'm Geistnigma, an enthusiastic student from France pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity. I have a strong passion for learning and I'm always eager to explore new technologies and concepts in the realm of digital security.

💻 My interests lie in the fascinating fields of Forensic Analysis, Pwn challenges, and Reverse Engineering. I love delving into the intricacies of code and uncovering vulnerabilities to improve overall system security.

🔍 Besides my hands-on experience in CTF challenges, I'm committed to sharing my knowledge and insights. You can often find me publishing detailed write-ups of CTF competitions and hacking challenges to help others learn and grow in the cybersecurity community.

📚 When I'm not immersed in cybersecurity adventures, you can find me experimenting with various hacking challenges and participating in CTF competitions to enhance my skills and knowledge.

Feel free to connect with me, and let's embark on this exciting journey of cybersecurity together! => geistnigma@proton.me
